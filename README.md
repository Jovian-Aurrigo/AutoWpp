Routing System Overview 

1. Unlock the Edit Button
Begin by unlocking the edit button. This enables editing features in the routing system interface.
2. Create a Route File
Click on the Create Route File button.
A file dialog will open. Create a new file and name it (e.g., example.yaml).
This becomes your default route file.
You can create multiple route files.
Each route file can contain multiple segments.
3. Load Route File
If you've already created a route file, use the Load Route File button.
This loads the existing route file for editing or testing.
4. Set Route File
Click the Set Route File button.
If no route has been set yet, it allows you to define route segments.
Click the Add Route button to add segments.
As you add them, you'll see new segments listed.
Use the route index scroll to view and manage different segment combinations.
Currently, up to four segments can be selected per route.
5. Close the Route Management Panel
The panel that opens when you press Set Route File is called the Route Management Panel.
After setting segments, you can close it using the Close Route button.
6. Run Routes
You can test individual routes using:
Run Route 1
Run Route 2
Run Route 3
Run Route 4
Ensure your vehicle is at the correct starting position for each route before starting.
